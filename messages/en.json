We released 2 t-shirt collections and organized 2 parties in 2021, but then our activities ceased.\n\nNow we are building \"120\" not only as a brand, but as a full-fledged community of creative individuals.\n\nWe believe there is a need for a platform where creators can find like-minded people and a friendly community. The marketplace features and $Block token rewards will help novice creators monetize their art, and IRL events will bring creativity from online to offline.\n\nThis support for art will provide many paths for development for both beginners and established creators."
